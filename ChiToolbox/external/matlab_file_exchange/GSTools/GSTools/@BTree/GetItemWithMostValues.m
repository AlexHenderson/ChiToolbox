%function GetItemWithMostValues
%
%This function searches for the item that has the most values attached (in
%most cases these values are the positions in a list, thus this function
%seeks for the item that appears the most in the list).
%
%Syntax:
%   retval = GetItemWithMostValues (Tree)
%
%Example:
%   sample = num2cell(['A'; 'B'; 'A'; 'B'; 'B'; 'A'; 'B'; 'C'; 'C']);
%   tree = BTree(sample);
%   Item = GetItemWithMostValues (tree)
