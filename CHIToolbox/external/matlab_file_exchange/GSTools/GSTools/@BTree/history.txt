BTree v0.3
Binary tree data structure for matlab

History:

v0.1:
- first implementation of the binary tree
- supports both numerical and stringlists as well as a mix of numbers and strings as input.

v0.2:
- adaptation in tree building: small change to prevent building a fully imbalanced tree, Currently a fully balanced tree cannot be garanteed (BTree still behaves best when using random lists as input).

v0.3:
- adaptations and speed optimisation to rebuild tree if it becomes to imbalanced
